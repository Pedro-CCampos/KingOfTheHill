# KingOfTheHill

This was a project that I made with four other colleagues for the Hackathon Challenge @ Academia de CÃ³digo where we are given a theme 15 minutes before a 24h timer starts. 
<p>We decided to make an application which the goal is to evaluate the quality of events and parties through an app, where you can rate events and the people attending said events. Also, the user is given challenges in order to increase their rating. We where not able to complete our vision within the 24 hour mark but this is what we accomplished during that challenge. </p>
<p>I was responsible for developing the <b>back-end</b> of the project using <b>Java, Spring, Hibernate</b> and <b>MySQl</b> as well has <b>connecting the back end and front-end</b> using <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>jQuery</b>.</p>

2. Run this maven command on KOTH back-end root folder

## Reminder

There are many things that were left incomplete because of the 24 hour time constraint, we didn't want to change it or improve it afterwards because it was part of the challenge to only have that limited amount of time to work on this project.
